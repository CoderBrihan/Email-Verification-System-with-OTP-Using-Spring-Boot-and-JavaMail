# Email-Verification-System-with-OTP-Using-Spring-Boot-and-JavaMail


Developed a secure Email Verification System using One-Time Password (OTP) authentication to validate user email addresses during registration and login processes.

The backend was implemented using Spring Boot and JavaMail Service to generate and send dynamic OTPs via email. The system ensures secure verification by validating OTPs within a defined expiration time.

The frontend was built using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a simple and responsive user interface for email input, OTP submission, and verification feedback.
